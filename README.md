# MenuMate

MenuMate is a simple and intuitive restaurant management system designed to streamline the ordering process for both customers and staff. The system provides real-time order tracking, kitchen management, and status updates.

## Features

- **Customer Ordering Interface**: Allows customers to intuitively select menu items and place orders.
- **Order Tracking**: Displays real-time statuses such as "Preparing" and "Ready" for both staff and customers.
- **Kitchen Management**: Kitchen staff can view orders, manage them efficiently, and mark orders as ready for pickup.
  
## How It Works

1. Customers browse the menu and place an order through an easy-to-use interface.
2. The order is sent to the kitchen system where staff can view the details.
3. The order status is updated to "Preparing" and then to "Ready" once completed.
4. Both customers and staff can track the order status in real time.
